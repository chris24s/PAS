## Marking Criteria
The software component of each project will be assessed as follows: 
- Documentation (10%): 
	- [ ]  Is there a Readme file? 
	- [ ] Are the modules explained clearly and sufficiently? 
	- [ ] Are there installation instructions or required software listed for complex systems? 
-  Robustness (10%): 
	- [ ] Does the code break for different test cases? 
	- [ ] Is the input data thoroughly validated? 
-  Modularity (10%): 
	- [ ] Is there sufficient abstraction and separation of input, processing and output components? 
	- [ ] Is there evidence of Design Patterns or MVC? 
- Scalability and Efficiency (10%): 
	- [ ] Is it easy to extend the functionality of the software? 
	- [ ] Are efficient algorithms used? 
	- [ ] Are there any data or memory leaks? 
-  Meets Project Goals (10%): 
	- [ ] Are all of the required features accounted for in the final product? 
	- [ ] Is there sufficient complexity in the final solution? 
-  Working Solution (30%): 
	- [ ] Does the system work completely? 
	- [ ] Are there failures for critical components? 
	- [ ] Are there failures for minor components? 
-  Student Code (20%): 
	- [ ] How much of the code did the students write themselves? 
	- [ ] How many repurposed modules have been used? 
	- [ ] How much open-source packages have been reused?
